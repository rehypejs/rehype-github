## What is this?

This project is a monorepo that contains many packages that can be used
together or on their own,
with defaults to match GitHub or with configuration to match your site,
to process user content for safe use on the web.

## When should I use this?

You can use these tools when you need to:

1. match GitHub in how it transforms markdown to HTML
2. build similar pipelines to bring user content to the masses

## Install

Currently,
install and use each package manually.

## Packages

  â€” turn normal line endings into hard breaks (**comments**)

  â€” viewscreen component for geojson and topojson
* [`viewscreen-mermaid`](packages/viewscreen-mermaid/)
  â€” viewscreen component for mermaid
* [`viewscreen-stl`](packages/viewscreen-stl/)
  â€” viewscreen component for STL (3D geometry)

See [`example/viewscreen/`](example/viewscreen/) on how to use them together.

To do:

* Change some things in `hast-util-to-mdast` to match current things
  that GitHub does there
* Investigate task lists
* Investigate port of treelights
* Investigate linking to labels,
  issues,
  pulls,
  files,
