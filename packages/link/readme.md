## What is this?

This plugin enhances links by marking them as external.
By default it appends `rel="nofollow"` to links that are neither local nor
go to `github.com`.

This plugin is part of a monorepo `rehype-github`.
See its readme for more info.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you want to match how github.com works or when you
want to build similar pipelines that have user content.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-github-link
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeGithubLink from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-github-link@0'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeGithubLink from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-github-link@0?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import rehypeGithubLink from 'rehype-github-link'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
  .use(rehypeGithubLink)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('<a href="https://example.com">link</a>')

console.log(String(file))
```

…now running `node example.js` yields:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">link</a>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is
[`rehypeGithubLink`][api-rehype-github-link].

### `rehypeGithubLink(options?)`

Plugin to enhance links.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `internal` (`Array<string>` or `string`, default: `'github.com'`)
    — hostname or hostnames to not mark as external
*   `rel` (`Array<string>` or `string`, default: `'nofollow'`)
    — relationship(s) of your site to external content, used in `rel`; You
    should probably set `['nofollow', 'ugc']`

## Bugs

There are no bugs with how GitHub does this, but they could use
`['nofollow', 'ugc']` instead.

## Authoring

There are no additional recommendations on how to author links in markdown.

## HTML

The markup that github.com adds is:

```html
rel="nofollow"
```

## CSS

No CSS is needed.

## Syntax

No syntax is applicable.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `rehype-parse` version 3+, `rehype-stringify` version
3+, `rehype` version 5+, and `unified` version 6+.

## Security

This package is safe.
