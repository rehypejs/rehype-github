## What is this?

This plugin enhances raw text by adding a mark to them that tells tools like
Google Translate to not translate them.
By default it adds `class="notranslate"` to `pre` and `code`.

This behavior is specific to github.com that only work in comments, not in
files.

This plugin is part of a monorepo `rehype-github`.
See its readme for more info.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you want to match how github.com works or when you
want to build similar pipelines that have user content.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-github-notranslate
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeGithubNoTranslate from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-github-notranslate@0'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeGithubNoTranslate from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-github-notranslate@0?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import rehypeGithubNoTranslate from 'rehype-github-notranslate'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
  .use(rehypeGithubNoTranslate)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('<code>xxx</code>')

console.log(String(file))
```

…now running `node example.js` yields:

```html
<code class="notranslate">xxx</code>
```

## Bugs

There are no particular bugs with how this work, other than that they could do
this on files too, and that they should perhaps use
`['code', 'kbd', 'pre', 'tt']` instead.
Furthermore, there are cases where you would want code to be translated, that
automation can’t solve.

## Authoring

There are no additional recommendations on how to author links in markdown.

## HTML

The markup for that github.com adds is:

```html
class="notranslate"
```

## CSS

No CSS is needed.

No syntax is applicable.

## Types

## Compatibility

versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

3+, `rehype` version 5+, and `unified` version 6+.
